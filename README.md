# Car Attribute Analysis (CAA)

The Car Attribute Analysis Project explores various car characteristics through data analysis, uncovering patterns and relationships between attributes (like type of car, color, tire, count, and license plate). This project can be used to segment cars based on features, predict future trends, and offer valuable insights for the automotive industry.
